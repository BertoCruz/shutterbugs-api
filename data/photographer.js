    bio: "Born in Mexico City, Graciela Iturbide studied filmmaking at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos between 1969 and 1972, and worked as an assistant to photographer Manuel Alvarez Bravo, who stimulated her interest in photography. She met to Henri Cartier-Bresson while traveling in Europe, and in 1978, was one of the founding members of the Mexican Council of Photography. Besides Cartier-Bresson and Alvarez Bravo, Tina Modotti was in important influence on Iturbide. A major exhibition of her work, 'External Encounters, Internal Imaginings: Photographs of Graciela Iturbide,' was presented at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in addition to retrospectives at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey in Mexico, and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. A monograph on her work, Graciela Iturbide: Images of the Spirit (1996), accompanied her Philadelphia show. Iturbide's exquisite high-contrast black-and-white prints convey the starkness of life for many of her subjects. Traveling through Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, and the Mexican community of East Los Angeles, Iturbide documents the uneasy cohabitation of ancient cultural rituals and contemporary adaptations and interpretations. One of her particular interests has been the role of women, and since 1979 she has photographed the Zapotec Indians of Juchitán, Oaxaca, among whom women are commonly accorded places of power, and stereotypical gender roles are frequently subverted. Iturbide uses photography to try to understand Mexico in its totality, as a combination of indigenous practices, and imported and assimilated Catholic religious practices, and foreign economic trade. Meredith Fisher Handy et al. Reflections in a Glass Eye: Works from the International Center of Photography Collection, New York: Bulfinch Press in association with the International Center of Photography, 1999, p. 219. Graciela Iturbide is the recipient of the 2015 Cornell Capa Lifetime Achievement Award.",
    user_notes:
      "I find Graciela's story teaching me how explorative photography can be. It can take me into curious places I would never thought I could imagine, and in those places I can come across some questions I need to be mindful of. One of them being, 'am I conveying truth to my pictures or am I injecting false narratives for my own benefit?'.<br>Graciela started her career by taking pictures of subjects that naturally caught her eye, a curiosity that led her to photograph indigenous regions in Mexico. Parts of her country she did not growing up in. Communities that welcomed her with open arms and allowed her to photograph their lives. This of course, as with the example of her famouse photograph 'Nuestra Señora de las Iguanas,' led her to recognize that there is always a risk that you're going to exoticize the subject. However, for her, this experience with the photograph of the lady with the iguanas on her head was purely by chance. She would never do that. She would never 'fall into folklore,' or perform in selfish ways with her subject for her personal gains.",

    bio: "Martínez’s work addresses fractured communities in his native Mexico. He often works symbolically to evoke a sense of emptiness, absence, and pain suffered by those affected by organized crime in the region.\\nHe is the recipient of the Eugene Smith Award 2019, was fellow of the Photography and Social Justice Program of The Magnum Foundation. He won the 2nd Prize of the World Press Photo contests 2019 in the category of long-term projects. Martínez was grantee of the Magnum Foundation in the grants: Emergency Fund and On Religion in 2016- 2017.\\nHis work has been featured in group shows in America, Europe, Africa and Asia.\\nHis work has been published by: The Wall Street Journal,Blomberg news, Lens NY times, Time, Vogue Italy, Vrij Nederland, Aperture.\\nMartínez became a Magnum Nominee member in 2020.",
    user_notes:
      "I'm really drawn by this photographer's ability to capture raw life from underrepresented communities in Mexico. In some of his pictures, Yael intentionally perforates and scratches his film negatives to bring his pictures to life. This technique literally shines light on the ways in which his subjects are affected by systemic violence from government and organized crime.\\nOne of my favorite projects of his is 'The Flower of Time' where he travels to indigenous pueblos in Guerrero, Mexico, to document the struggles these communities face.",
